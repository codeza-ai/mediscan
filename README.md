## Key Components

### Frontend Components

- **SymptomChecker**: Main component for symptom input and analysis
- **ResultDisplay**: Shows AI analysis results and recommendations
- **ModelToggle**: Switch between free and pro AI models
- **LoadingSpinner**: Visual feedback during API calls
- **Alert**: Error and notification display
- **Layout**: Common page structure with header and footer

### Backend Services

- **gemini.service.js**: Google Gemini AI integration
- **mongo.service.js**: MongoDB operations and query management
- **index.controller.js**: Request handling and response formatting

## ü§ñ Gemini AI Configuration

The application uses Google's Gemini AI models with carefully tuned parameters for medical symptom analysis:

### Model Parameters
- **Temperature**: `0.3` - Lower temperature for more consistent, focused responses
- **Top-K**: `40` - Limits vocabulary to top 40 most likely tokens
- **Top-P**: `0.85` - Nucleus sampling for balanced creativity and accuracy
- **Max Output Tokens**: `2048` - Sufficient length for detailed medical analysis

### Safety Guidelines
The AI is configured with strict healthcare-specific constraints:

- **No Medical Diagnosis**: AI cannot provide official medical diagnoses
- **No Treatment Prescription**: Cannot recommend specific medications or treatments
- **Educational Focus**: All responses are for informational purposes only
- **Mandatory Disclaimers**: Every response includes medical safety disclaimers
- **Scope Limitation**: Rejects non-medical queries and stays focused on symptom analysis

### Response Structure
All AI responses follow a structured JSON format:

```javascript
{
  conditions: ["Array of probable condition names"],
  next_steps: "String with recommended actions",
  disclaimer: "Mandatory educational safety disclaimer"
}
```

### System Instructions
The AI operates under comprehensive system instructions that ensure:
- Professional and educational tone
- Focus on general, well-known medical conditions
- Cautious and objective analysis
- Avoidance of unnecessary alarm
- Clear boundaries between AI assistance and professional medical care
